# PBoB Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated PBoB (Power Breakout Board) client functionality into the Sag BCP system to control RFSoC power via relay commands to the Oph PBoB server.

## New Files Created
1. **pbob_client.h** - Header file with function prototypes and configuration structure
2. **pbob_client.c** - UDP client implementation for communicating with Oph PBoB server

## Modified Files
1. **bcp_Sag.config** - Added pbob_client configuration section
2. **file_io_Sag.h** - Added pbob_client structure to config parameters
3. **file_io_Sag.c** - Added configuration reading for pbob_client section
4. **main_Sag.c** - Added PBoB client initialization and cleanup
5. **cli_Sag.c** - Added new rfsoc_on and rfsoc_off commands
6. **CMakeLists.txt** - Added pbob_client.c to build sources

## New CLI Commands

### rfsoc_on
- Sends UDP command "0;0" to Oph PBoB server (PBOB 0, Relay 0)
- Shows 40-second countdown for RFSoC bootup
- Provides user feedback on success/failure
- Logs all operations

### rfsoc_off
- Sends UDP command "0;0" to Oph PBoB server to toggle power OFF
- Provides user feedback on success/failure
- Logs all operations

## Communication Protocol
- Target: PBOB 0, Relay 0 (spectrometer power)
- Server: 172.20.3.11:8003 (Oph PBoB server)
- Protocol: UDP
- Command Format: "PBOB_ID;RELAY_ID" (e.g., "0;0")
- Response: "1" for success, other values for failure

## Status
READY FOR INTEGRATION - All functionality implemented and tested.
